**Terminally** is a cutting-edge AI-driven terminal agent designed to revolutionize your command-line interaction. By intelligently interpreting your natural language commands (prefixed with `/ter`), Terminally acts as a seamless bridge, translating your intent into powerful and efficient terminal actions.

At its core, Terminally is powered by a meticulously crafted system prompt (`system_prompt.mdx`), which orchestrates its behavior, capabilities, and interaction paradigms.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intuitive Natural Language Interface:** Say goodbye to cryptic commands! Interact with your terminal using clear, human-like instructions.
- **Smart File System Operations:** Effortlessly manage your files and directories: create, edit, delete, read, list, move, copy, and rename with ease.
- **Intelligent Command Execution:** Run shell commands with advanced control, including real-time output streaming, background processing for non-blocking tasks, and comprehensive output capture.
- **Streamlined Web Development Workflow:** Kickstart your web projects by generating basic application structures for popular frameworks like React, Flask, and MERN. Deploy your creations to platforms such as Vercel and Netlify directly from your terminal.
- **Efficient Python Environment Management:** Simplify your Python development by installing specific Python versions and creating isolated virtual environments with your required packages.
- **Modular & Extensible Design:** Built with a future-forward architecture, Terminally's action block system allows for seamless integration of new functionalities.
- **Built-in Safety Measures:** Your system's integrity is paramount. Terminally incorporates robust security checks to prevent the execution of potentially harmful commands.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/likhonsheikhofficial/Terminally.git](https://github.com/likhonsheikhofficial/Terminally.git)
    cd Terminally
    ```

2.  **Dive into the Brain: `system_prompt.mdx`:**
    Take a moment to explore the `system_prompt.mdx` file. This is the blueprint that defines Terminally's intelligence. You'll find details on its core identity, how it thinks, the command processing workflow, its functional domains, and the inner workings of each action block.

3.  **Explore the Possibilities: `prompt.txt`:**
    The `prompt.txt` file is your quick-start guide. It's filled with practical examples of natural language prompts you can use with Terminally once it's up and running.

4.  **Stay Tuned for Implementation!**
    The magic of Terminally is currently brewing! The actual code that brings this AI agent to life is under active development. Keep an eye out for updates on how to install and use Terminally directly in your terminal.

## üß† The Core Intelligence: `system_prompt.mdx`

The `system_prompt.mdx` file is the central nervous system of Terminally. It meticulously details:

- **Core Identity & Purpose:** Defining Terminally's role as your intelligent terminal assistant.
- **Mental Models:** Unveiling the cognitive process Terminally employs to understand and process your requests.
- **Command Processing Flow:** A clear visual diagram (powered by Mermaid) illustrating how your natural language input is transformed into executable actions.
- **Capability Domains:** A structured JSON representation of Terminally's functional areas, including file system management, command execution, web development utilities, and Python environment management, along with their specific actions and security considerations.
- **Action Blocks:** In-depth descriptions and the underlying Python code for each action Terminally can perform. These modular blocks cover:
    - **File System:** `create-file`, `edit-file`, `stream-file`.
    - **Command Execution:** `run-command`, `background-command`.
    - **Web Development:** `generate-app`, `deploy-app`.
    - **Python Management:** `install-python`, `create-virtualenv`.
    Each action block's documentation includes its purpose, parameters, the reasoning behind its design, the actual Python implementation, illustrative usage examples, and the expected output format.

## üí° Unleash the Potential: `prompt.txt`

The `prompt.txt` file is your source of inspiration. It showcases a variety of natural language prompts (always prefixed with `/ter`) designed to demonstrate Terminally's diverse capabilities and guide you on how to interact effectively with the AI agent.


Example prompts for Terminally
/ter create a file named notes.md with "# My Awesome Notes"
/ter append "- Remember to backup daily" to notes.md
/ter show me the first 10 lines of notes.md
/ter list all directories in the current path
/ter run node -v
/ter run a script called process_data.py in the background
/ter generate a basic flask app in the project/web directory
/ter deploy the web app in project/web to vercel
/ter install python version 3.11
/ter create a new virtual environment named venv-project using python 3.11
